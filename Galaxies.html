            <h2>Galaxies</h2>
            <p>Galaxies are vast systems of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter that are held together by gravity. They
                come in a variety of shapes and sizes, ranging from small, irregularly shaped dwarf galaxies to massive,
                spiral and elliptical galaxies that can contain billions of stars.</p>

            <p>The most common type of galaxy is the spiral galaxy, which has a flattened disk shape and spiral arms
                that contain most of the galaxy's stars, gas, and dust. Spiral galaxies also have a central bulge that
                contains a dense concentration of stars and often a supermassive black hole at its center. Examples of
                spiral galaxies include our Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy.Elliptical galaxies, on the other hand,
                are more spherically shaped and contain mostly old, red stars. They lack the spiral arms and disk
                structure of spiral galaxies and are often found in galaxy clusters, where they can be the largest and
                most massive members.
                Irregular galaxies, as the name suggests, have irregular shapes and lack the clear structure of spiral
                and elliptical galaxies. They can contain large amounts of gas and dust and are often the site of active
                star formation.</p>

            <p>Galaxies are not static objects; they can interact and collide with each other, causing gravitational
                disturbances that can lead to the formation of new stars and structures. The study of galaxies is an
                important area of astrophysics, as it can shed light on the history and evolution of the universe and
                the processes that govern the formation and behavior of galaxies.</p>

                        alt="Milky Way Galaxy">
                    <p>The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy that contains billions of stars, gas, dust, and dark
                        matter. It is one of the most studied and well-known galaxies in the universe, as it is also the
                        home of our own Solar System.</p>

                    <p> The Milky Way is approximately 100,000 light-years in diameter and contains between 100 and 400
                        billion stars. It has a central bulge and a flattened disk structure with spiral arms that
                        extend outwards. The disk contains young, hot stars and interstellar gas and dust, while the
                        bulge is made up of older, cooler stars.</p>


                    <p>In addition to its stars, the Milky Way is also believed to contain a large amount of dark
                        matter, a mysterious substance that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light but can be detected
                        through its gravitational effects. Dark matter is thought to make up about 85% of the total
                        matter in the universe.

                        The Milky Way is also home to a number of interesting objects and phenomena, such as star
                        clusters, nebulae, pulsars, and black holes. It is also the site of ongoing star formation, as
                        well as the occasional supernova explosion.</p>

                    <p>The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, is a majestic spiral galaxy located approximately
                        2.5 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Andromeda. It is the closest galaxy
                        to our Milky Way and is one of the most studied and well-known galaxies in the universe.</p>

                    <p>Andromeda is a massive galaxy, with a diameter of around 220,000 light-years, making it
                        approximately 2.5 times larger than our Milky Way. It contains an estimated one trillion stars,
                        many of which are similar to our Sun. Andromeda is also surrounded by a vast halo of hot gas and
                        dark matter, which gives the galaxy its characteristic gravitational influence.</p>

                    <p>Andromeda is often visible to the naked eye as a faint, hazy patch in the night sky, and is a
                        popular target for amateur astronomers and astrophotographers. Its proximity and size make it an
                        important target for scientific research, and it has been the subject of numerous studies and
                        observations across the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>

                    <p>The black hole in M87 is one of the most studied and well-known black holes in the universe, with
                        a mass estimated to be around 6.5 billion times that of the Sun. It is surrounded by a disk of
                        hot, ionized gas and produces a powerful jet of relativistic particles that extends for
                        thousands of light-years into space.</p>

                    <p>M87 is also notable for its bright and extended halo of diffuse gas, dust, and stars, which is

                        diameter, making it about one-tenth the size of the Milky Way. It contains a relatively high
                        amount of gas and dust, which has led to a high rate of star formation, with young, massive
                        stars being born at a much higher rate than in our Milky Way.</p>

                    <p>The Large Magellanic Cloud is also home to a number of interesting objects, including the
                        Tarantula Nebula, one of the largest and brightest emission nebulae known. This nebula is a
                        region of intense star formation and contains some of the most massive stars known.</p>

                        The Cartwheel Galaxy is a unique and striking object located approximately 500 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Sculptor. It is a type of galaxy known as a ring galaxy, which is formed through a rare collision between two galaxies.</p>
                        
                        <p>The collision that formed the Cartwheel Galaxy likely occurred around 100 million years ago and involved a smaller galaxy passing through the center of a larger spiral galaxy. The gravitational forces from the collision caused ripples in the interstellar gas and dust, which eventually settled into the characteristic ring shape.</p>
                        
                        <p>The ring of the Cartwheel Galaxy is approximately 150,000 light-years in diameter and contains numerous bright and massive star-forming regions. These regions are believed to be triggered by the shock waves from the collision, which compress the gas and dust, leading to the formation of new stars.</p>
                        
                        <p>Surrounding the ring is a diffuse disk of gas and dust, which is also undergoing active star formation. The Cartwheel Galaxy also has a prominent central bulge, which contains a large number of old and reddish stars.</p>
