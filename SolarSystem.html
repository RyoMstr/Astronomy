            <h2>Sun</h2>
            <p>
                The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System, around which all the planets orbit. It is a
                nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that creates its magnetic field.
                The Sun's surface, known as the photosphere, has a temperature of around 5,500 degrees Celsius (9,932
                degrees Fahrenheit), and emits light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation.

                The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and is considered a middle-aged star. It has a diameter of
                approximately 1.4 million kilometers (870,000 miles), making it about 109 times the size of the Earth.
                Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar
                System.

                The Sun's energy is produced through nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms are fused together to form
                helium. This process releases a tremendous amount of energy in the form of light and heat, which is
                responsible for sustaining life on Earth. The Sun also emits a stream of charged particles known as the
                solar wind, which interacts with the Earth's magnetic field to create the auroras or Northern and
                Southern Lights.</p>

            <h2>Mercury</h2>
            <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and is the closest planet to the Sun. It is named
                after the Roman messenger god, Mercury, known for his speed, as the planet moves the fastest in its
                orbit around the Sun, completing one revolution in just 88 Earth days.

                Mercury is a rocky planet, similar in composition to Earth's Moon, with a heavily cratered surface. It
                has a very thin atmosphere, with no protective magnetic field, which exposes the surface to intense
                solar radiation and solar winds. As a result, the surface temperature of Mercury ranges from around -173
                degrees Celsius (-280 degrees Fahrenheit) at night to 427 degrees Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit)
                during the day, making it the hottest planet in the Solar System.

                Due to its close proximity to the Sun, it has a very short year and day, with one year being equivalent
                to just 88 Earth days and one day being approximately 176 Earth days long. This means that a single day
                on Mercury lasts longer than a year.

                Mercury is also known for its peculiar orbit, which is elongated and elliptical, causing it to appear to
                move backwards in the sky at certain times, a phenomenon known as retrograde motion.

                Despite being the smallest planet, Mercury still has some interesting features, such as cliffs that can
                be up to a mile high and craters that contain water ice, despite the planet's scorching surface
                temperatures. Overall, Mercury is a fascinating planet, and much remains to be discovered about its
                unique characteristics and properties.</p>

            <h2>Venus</h2>
            <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth's sister planet due to its similar
                size, mass, and composition. However, Venus has a much harsher environment than Earth, with an extremely
                thick and toxic atmosphere that traps heat and makes the surface of the planet incredibly hot.

                Venus has a rocky surface with mountains, valleys, and craters, but its surface is almost completely
                obscured by a thick layer of clouds made up of sulfuric acid. These clouds reflect sunlight, giving
                Venus a bright, shiny appearance in the sky.

                The planet rotates very slowly, taking around 243 Earth days to complete a single rotation, which is
                longer than its year, which is approximately 225 Earth days long. Venus also rotates in the opposite
                direction to most other planets in the Solar System, with the sun rising in the west and setting in the
                east.

                Due to its thick atmosphere, Venus experiences a strong greenhouse effect, which keeps the planet's
                surface temperature at a scorching 462 degrees Celsius (864 degrees Fahrenheit), making it the hottest
                planet in the Solar System. This makes it difficult for any spacecraft to land on the surface, and only
                a handful of missions have been able to do so.

                Despite the harsh conditions, Venus remains a fascinating planet for scientists to study, and there is
                much to learn about its geology, atmosphere, and unique features, such as the presence of lightning and
                volcanic activity.</p>

            <h2>Earth</h2>
            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the only known planet in the universe to support life. It
                is a rocky planet with a diameter of approximately 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles) and a mass of 5.97 x
                10^24 kilograms.

                Earth has a unique atmosphere, which contains a mixture of gases that are essential for life, such as
                oxygen and nitrogen, as well as trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases. The atmosphere also
                protects the planet from harmful solar radiation and meteoroids.

                The planet has a solid surface, composed of continents and oceans, which are in constant motion due to
                plate tectonics. Earth's surface also features diverse landscapes, such as mountains, deserts, forests,
                and oceans, which provide habitats for a wide variety of plant and animal species.

                The planet's climate is influenced by various factors, such as its distance from the Sun, the tilt of
                its axis, and the distribution of its land masses and oceans. Earth's climate is also impacted by human
                activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which contribute to global warming
                and climate change.

                Earth is also home to a diverse array of life forms, from tiny microorganisms to large mammals. Human
                beings, in particular, have developed complex societies and cultures, and have made significant
                advancements in technology and scientific knowledge.

            <h2>Mars</h2>
            <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often called the Red Planet due to its rusty red color
                caused by iron oxide or rust on its surface. It is a rocky planet with a diameter of approximately 6,779
                kilometers (4,212 miles) and a mass of 6.39 x 10^23 kilograms.

                Mars has a thin atmosphere, with no protective magnetic field, which exposes the surface to intense
                solar radiation and solar winds. The atmosphere is mostly made up of carbon dioxide, with trace amounts
                of nitrogen and argon. Due to its thin atmosphere, Mars experiences large temperature variations, with
                temperatures ranging from as low as -140 degrees Celsius (-220 degrees Fahrenheit) at the poles to as
                high as 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) at the equator during the day.

                The planet's surface is composed of a variety of geological features, such as mountains, valleys,
                craters, and plains. Mars also has the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, and the
                deepest canyon, Valles Marineris. Mars is also known for its polar ice caps, which consist of a mixture
                of water ice and carbon dioxide.

                Mars is a focus of exploration for scientists, as it is believed to have once had liquid water on its
                surface, and may have had the conditions necessary to support life. Several missions, both robotic and
                manned, have been sent to Mars to study its geology, climate, and potential habitability.</p>

            <h2>Jupiter</h2>
            <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and is the largest planet in the Solar System. It is a gas giant
                with a diameter of approximately 142,984 kilometers (88,846 miles) and a mass of 1.898 x 10^27
                kilograms, which is more than twice the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System combined.

                Jupiter's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of other gases, such
                as methane, ammonia, and water vapor. The atmosphere contains colorful bands of clouds, which are
                created by high winds that blow in opposite directions at different latitudes.

                Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field, which is the strongest of any planet in the Solar System. The
                magnetic field is thought to be generated by the motion of metallic hydrogen in the planet's core.

                The planet has a complex system of moons, with over 79 known moons, including four large moons known as
                the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These moons are of particular interest to
                scientists, as they may have the potential to support life.

                Jupiter is also known for its numerous storms, including the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been
                raging for at least 350 years. The storm is larger than the size of Earth and is thought to be caused by
                the interaction between different gases in the planet's atmosphere.

                Jupiter has been visited by several spacecraft, including the Pioneer, Voyager, Galileo, and Juno
                missions, which have provided valuable data and images of the planet and its moons. Jupiter remains a
                fascinating planet, with much to discover about its atmosphere, magnetic field, and unique features.</p>

            <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is one of the gas giants in the Solar System. It is known for
                its distinctive ring system, which is made up of icy particles ranging in size from tiny grains to large
                boulders. Saturn has a diameter of approximately 116,460 kilometers (72,367 miles) and a mass of 5.68 x
                10^26 kilograms.

                Saturn's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of other gases,
                such as methane and ammonia. The atmosphere features bands of clouds similar to those of Jupiter, but
                they are less colorful and less prominent.

                Saturn's ring system is composed of seven main rings, which are labeled using letters of the alphabet in
                the order they were discovered. The rings are very thin, with a thickness of only a few tens of meters,
                and are thought to be the remnants of a moon or a comet that was destroyed by the planet's gravity.

                Saturn has a complex system of moons, with over 80 known moons. One of the most interesting of these
                moons is Titan, which is the second-largest moon in the Solar System and the only moon known to have a
                dense atmosphere. Titan's atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen, with trace amounts of methane
                and other gases.

                Saturn has a strong magnetic field, which is the second strongest of any planet in the Solar System. The
                magnetic field is thought to be generated by the motion of metallic hydrogen in the planet's core.

                Saturn has been visited by several spacecraft, including the Pioneer, Voyager, Cassini, and Huygens
                missions, which have provided valuable data and images of the planet, its rings, and its moons. Saturn
                remains a fascinating planet, with much to discover about its unique characteristics and potential for
                future exploration.</p>

            <h2>Uranus</h2>
            <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is one of the ice giants in the Solar System. It has a
                diameter of approximately 50,724 kilometers (31,518 miles) and a mass of 8.68 x 10^25 kilograms.

                Uranus has a unique feature in that it rotates on its side, with its axis of rotation tilted at an angle
                of approximately 98 degrees relative to its orbit around the Sun. This unusual orientation is thought to
                have been caused by a collision with a large object early in the planet's history.

                The atmosphere of Uranus is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with small amounts of methane,
                which gives the planet its blue-green color. Uranus has a faint ring system, which was discovered in
                1977, and which consists of narrow, dark rings.

                Uranus has a complex system of moons, with 27 known moons, the largest of which are Miranda, Ariel,
                Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. These moons are made up of rock and ice and have a variety of surface
                features, including craters, valleys, and mountains.

                Uranus has a weak magnetic field, which is tilted at an angle of about 60 degrees relative to its
                rotation axis. This is believed to be due to the planet's unusual rotation and magnetic field generation
                processes.

                Uranus has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew by the planet in 1986 and provided
                valuable data and images of the planet, its rings, and its moons. Uranus remains a fascinating planet,
                with much to learn about its unique characteristics and its place in the Solar System.</p>

            <h2>Neptune</h2>
            <p>Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and is the most distant planet in the Solar System. It has a
                diameter of approximately 49,244 kilometers (30,775 miles) and a mass of 1.02 x 10^26 kilograms.

                Neptune has a bluish color, which is due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere. Its atmosphere is
                primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane, with small amounts of other gases. Neptune has a
                faint ring system, which was discovered in 1984, and which consists of dark, narrow rings.

                Neptune has a complex system of moons, with 14 known moons, the largest of which is Triton. Triton is of
                particular interest to scientists, as it is the only large moon in the Solar System that orbits in the
                opposite direction of its planet's rotation. Triton is also thought to have originated from the Kuiper
                Belt, a region of the Solar System beyond Neptune that is home to many icy objects.

                Neptune has a strong magnetic field, which is tilted at an angle of about 47 degrees relative to its
                rotation axis. The magnetic field is thought to be generated by the motion of metallic hydrogen in the
                planet's core.

                Neptune has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew by the planet in 1989 and
                provided valuable data and images of the planet, its rings, and its moons. Neptune remains a fascinating
                planet, with much to learn about its unique characteristics and its place in the Solar System.</p>
